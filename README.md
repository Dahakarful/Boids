# Boids

Make an AI of fishes.

The V1 is just a representation of fiches by vectors.

The V2 is an improve, fiches can now detect collision between them, and like a boids of fish they follow when they encounter.

The V3 is the same as V2 but now they detect the limit of map in top and bottom.

The V4 is just an improve to add random color to fish.

If you want to change the script, go to the `ihm.py` file, on the line:

`ocean = Ocean(20, 500, 500)` the first argument is the number of fish,
the second is the width of the window and the third the height.
